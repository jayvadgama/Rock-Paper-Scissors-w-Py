Rock Paper Scissors with Python

The Python rock-paper-scissors game is a simple game where the computer randomly chooses between rock, paper, and scissors, and the player also selects one. 
The two selections are then compared to determine who wins the game.

A while loop keeps the play going until or unless the user decides to quit the game.
